# AntCMS

AntCMS is being largely rebuilt for better, faser, easier functionality.

## Differences between "new" and "main"

- The main app now uses Flight for routing
- Optimizations
- Much improved code stylining and code quality
- Plugins do not yet work as they need to be rebuilt
- AntCMS will automatically perform brotli, zstd, and gzip output compression as long as related extensions are installed
